          Nearly all of my friends have one big thing in common while we are playing a fighting game: They <b>hate</b> the characters I pick. So, to commemorate that, here's a tierlist of how much each character makes them rage and scream at me. [...]

          Guilty Gear Strive. I like it. Sure, my relationship with it is complicated at best, strenuous at worst, but to say I outright disilke it or something like that would be a lie. Strive is the latest game of the Guilty Gear series,
           the first game to come out in more than 4 or so years, and it is very, very different from it's predecessors in a few very important ways. The game was developed with the intent of hooking in new players, and I can say from 
           experience, it worked. Strive is the first fighting game that not only me, but a good amount of people in my friend group, have actually gotten into and enjoyed, that's in part due to it being a "simpler" game than the
            previous ones (Xrd and XX notoriously required a whole glossary to understand all of the systems in those games), in part due to Strive looking absolutely amazing, and in another part due to the banger soundtrack. [...]

        <br>
        <p class="par">
          Risk Of Rain, to those unfamiliar, is one of the original indie Roguelikes. Though 2 years older than Binding of Isaac and never quite reaching the same status,
          the original game became a cult classic of sorts, or at least it did to me. As a kid, Risk Of Rain was one of my favorite games, though one I was far from good at, and one that I didn't play that much of , it still held a great
          deal of significance to me for one reason or another, I just loved everything about it. The music, which to this day holds up, the art style, the graphics, the writing and the gameplay.
          Even if at the time my grasp on the gameplay and how it worked on a deeper level was very loose I still decided to grasp onto it when I found out that a sequel to the game had been in development and in Early Acess on Steam. [...]
